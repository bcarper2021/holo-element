# holo-element
Product display application for 3D product models on Microsoft Hololens

This application is intended for use in trade shows for products that are too large to take to every trade show. 

The application handles spawning products from a menu of objects. It allows for the manipulation of the objects through space using mixed reality toolkit functionality as well as scaling of objects to size. The application also renders environments that the products can be placed in to show the product in a sample use case.
